The data log of water flow values can be queried using an HTTP endpoint that
returns a JSON list of [timestamp, flowrate] pairs for the time period
requested.

 The start and end values are UNIX timestamp seconds and are used to filter the
 database query.  The start may be specified as a negative number to query
 relative to the current time.  The end value is optional and defaults to now.

 To query for the last hour of data:
